Intstruction to run the code:

1. Add the path of images to be stitched in the "image_list[]" in application.py (Line 169). 
    Some sample images that can be stitched are given in "test_images" directory.
2. You can adjust the threshold for Lowe's Ratio (Line 188) and number of RANSAC iterations (Line 189) in application.py.
3. Currently the code blends images using "Max Pixel Intensity" method. This might take some time to run.
4. To use "Weighted Distance Maps" to blend images comment lines 78-95 and uncomment lines 98-145.
5. Run application.py
6. You can observe detected keypoints in "image1_keypoints.jpg" and "image2_keypoints.jpg", and the matched keypoints in "matched_keypoints.jpg".
7. Final stitched panorama is stored in "stitched_panorama.png"
